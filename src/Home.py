    # Hi there ðŸ‘‹
                
    This is is Streamlit application which contains a suite of useful apps powered by LLMs. 
    These apps combine cutting-edge technologies like text generation via LLMs, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), image generation, 
    audio transcription etc.
    
    This suite currently includes the following apps:
    
    - **Document Chat App** - for chatting with your PDF documents
    - **Simple Document QA App** - for performing QA on your PDF documents
    - **Web Page QA** - for performing QA on content from web pages
                
    These apps were birthed from simple experiments to apply LLMs to real-world problems, I genuinely hope they are useful for you ðŸ’—!
